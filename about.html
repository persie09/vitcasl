            <h2>CORPORATE ALL STAR LEAGUE</h2>
            <p>It is a rare chance for executives to explore the wealth of personalities and skill sets that exist within their organizational structure and work towards the rebuilding and rejuvenating their internal framework.
            A happy employee almost always translates to a productive employee! A productive organization is one that stands the best chance to prosper. Hence, this event is not just about the leisure and the fun- it's about the big picture. A dream of India and all its corporate forces standing tall if not taller amongst the likes of China, USA and the European Union will come to fruition.</p>  
            <p>This event also aims at achieving harmony and synergy between corporations. Competition is good but a healthier environment to compete in would result in ascension to heights that visionaries envision. Having a better relationship with your competitor is an interesting prospect and we give you the opportunity to make that relationship productive and mutually beneficial.</p>  
            <p>Competition isn't always one dimensional. To compete in the office is as important as competing outside the corporate fortresses. Show your peers that it's not just unilateral excellence that you emulate, rather, all round greatness. A sweet victory outside the office is sometimes sweeter than victories inside.</p> 
            <p>This event also gives the people involved the opportunity to explore the extravagance of Southern India - the food, the culture, the people and the Gods. Also, get to experience VIT and VITBS, one of India's greatest private institutes, in fashion unlike any other. This campus houses about 28000 students strong and also faculties pioneering the fields of technology, innovation and business.</p> 
            <p>Most importantly, this event is a showcase of India's proudest business establishments. The A-listers of the corporate world showing their strength in front of a student population that remains unparalleled across the world. 
            Witness the greatness and the glamour come November, right here at VIT. This event promises to be like no other and more.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;">GAME ON!</p>
